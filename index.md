## Welcome

![logo](/assets/images/flags_bottom.png)

OWASP Saskatoon is a newly formed chapter to help the information security and development communities in Saskatoon and area deliver secure software applications for all of their users. We will work towards our goals through communication and collaboration with as many different voices as we can. We look forward to helping the community grow.

## Participation
The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. 

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapters Policy](/www-policy/operational/chapters). Financial contributions should only be made online using the authorized online donation button. 

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our [Projects](/projects/), [Local Chapters](/chapters/), [Events](/events/), [Online Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.com/){:target='_blank'}, and [Community Slack Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/){:target='_blank'}. We especially encourage diversity in all our initiatives. OWASP is a fantastic place to learn about application security, to network, and even to build your reputation as an expert. We also encourage you to be [become a member](/membership/) or consider a [donation](/donate/) to support our ongoing work.

### Speakers
#### Tyler Dewald
Tyler is an avid dog walker, gardener and occasional application security enthusiast.

#### Gavin Klondike

Gavin Klondike is the principle security consultant at GlitchSecure, and an independent researcher specializing in penetration testing and AI. He is the former head of demos and workshops for the AI Village and the lead author for two of the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications. He is also the founder of the YouTube channel NetSec Explained, where he shares intermediate to advanced level network security topics in an easy-to-understand way. He is dedicated to sharing his knowledge with the next generation of cybersecurity professionals, to help them level up their skills. His current research focus is in finding ways to address the cybersecurity skills gap, by utilizing AI/ML to augment the capabilities of existing security resources.

###  Talks

#### Tyler's Talk
As AI adoption accelerates across enterprises, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is quickly becoming the standard for how LLM systems interact with external tools and resources—but with this innovation comes significant security challenges for SOC managers and security professionals. This session takes a practical look at how this emerging standard operates and gives actionable intelligence on potential security blindspots in your organization's defences. We'll examine real-world attack scenarios where familiar threats find new pathways through MCP implementations, from credential harvesting and arbitrary code execution to the more insidious "rug pull" attacks and context poisoning unique to this protocol. You will walk away knowing more about the threats your company faces and how you can build an actionable security strategy for defending your organization.

#### Gavin's Talk
Learn to build AI applications with enhanced security, implementing best practices for secure and responsible AI development. In this session, Gavin will walk through the OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model (LLM) applications — and cover the most critical security risks associated with AI systems. As the author of two of the OWASP top 10, he’ll share lessons from his work in penetration testing, practical ways these risks show up in real-world environments, and strategies to mitigate them.
